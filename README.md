The project focus on creating a Cryptographic Hashing Algorithm for generating Hash value for the given input string with help of Python Programming Language.
- The Main idea of the algorithm is generating an encoding for the number of occurence and for the unique position sequence of every character in the sequence and then combining them.
- The number of occurence and the unique position sequence of every character are the characterisics that differ a word from another word
